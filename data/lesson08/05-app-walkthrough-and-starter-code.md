**Download the Mars Real Estate App:**

1. To get started, either download the **Mars Real Estate** starter code from [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/andfun-kotlin-mars-real-estate/archive/Starter-Code.zip), or you can clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/andfun-kotlin-mars-real-estate) and check out the **Starter-Code** branch.

2. Familiarize yourself with the app: Everything provided has been covered in previous lessons.

3. Build and run the app. The starter app doesn't do much right now, but don't worry, we'll get there!

4. By the time you take this course, you may be prompted to update the Android Gradle Plugin, or versions of various libraries when you load the project. In general, you shouldn't have issues updating the plugin, but updating the libraries can expose you to unexpected compatibility issues. If you run into "strange" compilation errors, revert to using the same combination of libraries as the solution app.
