<p>One of the great things about Android development is that the tools run on all the popular platforms; Macs, Windows, and Linux machines, including some powerful Chromebooks.</p>
<p><strong>Download Android Studio</strong></p>
<p>Going to the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">studio website</a> will take you to the correct download link for your platform. You can read more information about installing Android Studio <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install">here</a>.</p>
<p>Android Studio is a large application; currently, the base installer is 927 - 1007 megabytes. Make sure you have several gigabytes of free storage on your machine to install Studio as well as the SDK and emulator images you'll need and want for development. Also, it can take a while to download. Check the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/#windows">System Requirements</a> part of the download page for more information on what you'll need to run Studio.</p>
<p><strong>The Android Emulator</strong></p>
<p>The Android Emulator relies on a technology called virtualization and takes advantage of the graphics processor in your development machine for high performance. Virtualization must be supported by both your CPU and Operating System. If you are having trouble getting hardware acceleration to work in the emulator, read <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration">this article</a> for more information.</p>
