<p>The screencasts for these lessons were done with <strong>Android Studio Version 3.3</strong> , which is currently in Beta, which you can download from the Beta Channel in Android Studio. Select the Preferences menu (or Settings in Windows) and search for Appearances and Behavior &gt; System Settings &gt; Updates. There you can select Beta Channel and then click Check Now to locate and download the new version. If you want to learn more about Channels, see our Troubleshooting Guide <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5be2884a_troubleshooting-guide-developing-android-apps-in-kotlin/troubleshooting-guide-developing-android-apps-in-kotlin.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're curious about what API level 19 refers to, you can learn more <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history">here</a>. This will also be discussed later in the lesson</p>

<h2 id="1-welcome-to-android-studio">1. Welcome to Android Studio</h2>
<p>First, open Android Studio. You should see this window. Go ahead and click "Start a new Android Studio Project". An Android Studio Project typically means the code and files for one Android Application.</p>

<h2 id="2-choose-your-project">2. Choose your Project</h2>
<p>On the next page you will be presented with several device platform tabs, each with different templates for adding an Activity.</p>
<p>From the "Phone and Tablet" tab choose "Empty Activity," and click "Next" again.</p>

<h2 id="3-configure-android-project">3. Configure Android Project</h2>
<p>For this app use this configuration:</p>
<p>Name: Dice Roller<br>
Package: com.example.android.diceroller<br>
Project location: &lt; Your choice of where to save this project on your computer &gt;<br>
Language: Leave the default value<br>
Minimum API: leave the default values<br></p>
<p>We've decided to build this project for "Phone and Tablet" with Minimum SDK of API 19. As of the time we wrote this course, that gave us 95.3% coverage of devices and allowed us to have support for many modern features.</p>
<p>Remember that you can use the "Help me choose" link to see the Android Platform/API Version distribution to see the percentage of active devices running with each API.</p>
<p>Finally, click "Finish" to create your Dice Roller project.</p>
<p>Depending on your computer and network speed, it might take a minute to set up and build your project. This might be a good time to do a stretch, get some tea, or start watching the next video.</p>
