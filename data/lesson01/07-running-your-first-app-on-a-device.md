<p>Written instructions on how to enable the developer options and debugging in our device are <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you use Windows, you will need to install the appropriate USB driver. For that you can follow the instructions <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb">here</a>. Mac and Linux users can skip this step.</p>
<p>When you connect your device, you should see a pop-up on the phone asking to allow USB debugging. You can tick the "Always allow" option as shown in the image to remember this computer. Click "OK".</p>
<p>You can now start running apps on your device.</p>
<p>If you still find issues during installation, please refer to this <a target="_blank" href="troubleshooting-guide-developing-android-apps-in-kotlin.pdf">Troubleshooting Guide</a>.</p>
