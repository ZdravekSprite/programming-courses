<h3>Quiz Question</h3>
<p>The user opens a physics simulation that takes a lot of heavy computation to display. Then they get a phone call. During the phone call, should you keep computing the positions of objects in the physics simulation?</p>
<ul>
<li>-Yes</li>
<li>+No</li>
<button>Submit</button>

<p>When you take a phone call, you no longer see the physics simulation app. If one of the purposes of the physics simulation is to be viewed, then running the simulation when nobody is looking is wasteful of your deviceâ€™s limited resources.</p>
<button>Try Again</button>

<p>Since the user is no longer looking at your physics sim, in most cases you can safely stop CPU intensive calculations that display and run the physics simulation.</p>
