<h3>Quiz Question</h3>
<p>Given what we just explored about lifecycle state, answer the following. Right now we initialize dessertsSold to 0 at declaration. Let's say we also set dessertsSold to 0 in onCreate. What, if anything, would change?</p>
<p>+The app would work the same</p>
<p>-Whenever you navigate away from the activity and come back, you'd lose the revenue value</p>
<p>-The app would crash</p>
<p>-Whenever you pressed the share button, the game would restart</p>
<p>-You'd never be able to get beyond making cupcakes</p>
<button>Submit</button>

<p>Now would be a good time to add in the code and run the app.</p>
<p>How did the app behave after doing this?</p>
<button>Try Again</button>

<p>That's right!</p>
<button>Continue</button>
