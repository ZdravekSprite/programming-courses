<h3 id="the-starter-code-for-trivia-app">The Starter Code for Trivia App</h3>
<p>In this lesson, you'll be working with the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/udacity/andfun-kotlin-android-trivia">Android Trivia app</a>. You'll be responsible for wiring together all of the app's navigation, including buttons, a menu, a navigation drawer and more. Because this lesson focuses on navigation, it helps to have a few pre-built fragments to navigate between. We've built these for you in the starter code, which you'll download next.</p>
<h3 id="download-the-code-for-this-lesson">Download the Code for this Lesson</h3>
<p>You have two options for the code in this lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can download a zip file of the starter code <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/udacity/andfun-kotlin-android-trivia/archive/starter-code.zip">here</a></li>
<li>If youâ€™re familiar with git, you can clone the entire git repository. This includes <code>//TODO</code> instructions and solution states for every step of building navigation for the app. To work with the git repository, use the example here: <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/udacity/andfun-kotlin-android-trivia/tree/starter-code#how-to-use-this-repo-while-taking-the-course">code README</a> to learn how the repos are set up, and how to navigate the code and branches. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="run-the-starter-code">Run the Starter Code</h3>
<p><strong>1. Open the starter code.</strong>
<br>Open up Android Studio and instead of selecting Start a new Android Studio project, click <em>Import project (Gradle, Eclipse ADT, etc.)</em>.</p>

<p>When opening the code, if you see pop-ups asking to update the gradle plugin, choose <strong>Don't remind me again for this project</strong>. </p>

<p>This pop-up occurs when the version of Android Studio that the code was written on is behind the version of Android Studio you're using. Since it's hard to future proof code, we generally recommend that you do not update the plugin. If you choose to update to a newer version, there is no guarantee that your code will work as expected, although it usually will. You can read more in the <a target="_blank" href="troubleshooting-guide-developing-android-apps-in-kotlin.pdf">Troubleshooting Guide</a>. </p>
<p><strong>2. Run the code.</strong>
<br>
Before changing any of the code, make sure the starting code runs.</p>

<p>Now you're ready to start implementing navigation!</p>
