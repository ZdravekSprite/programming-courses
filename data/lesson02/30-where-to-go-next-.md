<p>We talked about ART. </p>
<p>It turns out that going from demo to art can take a chunk of work â€¦ and is a lot of fun.
Think about this simple game.
Start from the final code in the repo.
How can you make this a complete game? </p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use images instead of colors, and reveal the images. You can even create a picture memory game! </li>
<li>Use one image and break it up into sections to reveal over time. </li>
<li>Get rid of the text and buttons and just fill the screen with boxes. Implement one of Piet Mondrian's Paintings!</li>
<li>Take the AboutMe app and remake it using ConstraintLayout with a more creative arrangement of information. </li>
<li>Style the app to uniquely represent you and your personality.</li>
</ul>
