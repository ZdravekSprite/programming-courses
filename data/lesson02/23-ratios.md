<h3>Quiz Question</h3>
<p>In which of the following situations might it be useful to use ratios for constraining the size of a view or view group?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A view needs to have a certain aspect ratio to accommodate an image, no matter what the screen orientation or display size is.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to create a layout with squares that is adaptable but forces the squares to remain square.</p></li>
<li><p>Your app needs a layout that always matches the aspect ratio of the system camera.</p></li>
</ul>
<button>Submit</button>

<p>Ratios are determined at design time.</p>
TRY AGAIN

<p>Ratios are most useful when your layout has views that need to keep their shape / aspect ratio even when the screen orientation or dimensions change.</p>
