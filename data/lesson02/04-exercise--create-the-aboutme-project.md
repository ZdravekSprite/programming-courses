<p><strong>NOTE</strong> We recommend you update to Android Studio Version 3.3 . You can download it from the Beta Channel in Android Studio. Select the Preferences menu (or Settings in Windows) and search for Updates. There you can select "Beta Channel" and then click on "Check Now" to locate and download the new version.</p>
<p>Now it’s your turn to complete this exercise.</p>
<p>Every app in Android Studio starts with creating a project. </p>

<h2 id="2-choose-your-project">2. Choose your Project</h2>
<p>On the next page you will be presented with several device platform tabs, each with different templates for adding an Activity.</p>
<p>From the "Phone and Tablet" tab choose "Empty Activity," and click "Next" again.</p>

<h2 id="3-configure-android-project">3. Configure Android Project</h2>
<p>For this app use this configuration:</p>
<p>Name: About Me</p>
<p>Package: com.example.android.aboutme<br>
Project location: &lt; Your choice of where to save this project on your computer &gt;<br>
Language: Kotlin<br>
Minimum API: leave the default values</p>
<p>We've decided to build this project for "Phone and Tablet" with Minimum SDK of API 19. As of the time we wrote this course, that gave us 95.3% coverage of devices and allowed us to have support for many modern features.</p>
<p>Remember that you can use the "Help me choose" link to see the Android Platform/API Version distribution to see the percentage of active devices running with each API.</p>
<p>Finally, click "Finish" to create your About Me project.</p>
<p>Depending on your computer and network speed, it might take a minute to set up and build your project. This might be a good time to do a stretch, get some tea, or start watching the next video.</p>
